The following files contain Windows-only tweaks:

userChrome-files/dark_context_menus.css
userChrome-files/dark_sidebar.css
userChrome-files/page_info.css
userChrome-files/tab_line_color.css
userChrome-files/dark_dialogs.css
userContent-files/all_about_pages.css

The following files contain non Windows-only tweaks:

userChrome-files/bookmarks_popup.css
userChrome-files/page_info.css

Because @media is broken in Firefox 58, these tweaks will be forced onto all Operating Systems until the release of Firefox 59.
For now, macOS versions can be found in the "\alternative_user_files\macOS" folder.

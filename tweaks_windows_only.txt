The following files contain Windows-only tweaks:

userChrome-files/dark_context_menus.css
userChrome-files/dark_sidebar.css
userChrome-files/page_info.css
userChrome-files/tab_line_color.css
userContent-files/all_about_pages.css

Because @media is broken in Firefox 58, these tweaks will be forced onto all Operating Systems until the release of Firefox 59.
